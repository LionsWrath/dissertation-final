    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute the cotree of $\graphG$.
        \item Compute the conflict graph  $CG_\mapFunc$.
        \item For each cycle in $CG_\mapFunc$ determine if it is a zero-cycle or a one-cycle.
        \item Compute $\cycleMatchingGraph$ using the zero-cycles from $CG_\mapFunc$.
        \item Compute a maximum matching in $\cycleMatchingGraph$.
        \item For each pair of zero-cycles matched in the computed maximum matching, perform a cutback swap using any edge between vertices of both cycles.
        \item Solve the remaining zero-cycles with the procedure implied by the proof of  Lemma~\ref{lem:s_zerocycle} and the remaining one-cycles with the procedure implied by the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:s_onecycle}.
        \item Return resulting swap sequence as $\swapSeq$.
